			        		One of my biggest successes over the last year has been transitioning my career from professional golfer to developer in just three months. For the past seven years I have been playing professional golf all over the world. Sustaining an injury at the end of last year was a blessing in disguise as it enabled me to revisit the passion I've always had for coding.
			        		<br>
			        		<br>
			        		I joined General Assembly in November 2015 to do the Web Development immersive course. It has been one of the most rewarding and interesting times of my life so far. Not being able to play golf was pretty tough but taking on this new adventure was so much fun, I have met some incredible people along the way who have made that transition so much easier.
			        		<br>
			        		<br>
			        		The next part of this journey is going to be the most exciting. I can't wait to take all of the knowledge that I have learnt so far and contribute to an innovative tech team on some really cool products. I really enjoy front-end development especially working with the MEAN stack. I would like to continue my learning investigating some cool new frameworks like Meteor.

		        			<p>Niall has got relocated to GA in Egypt but he got lost on the river Nile on his way to work. Can you help him get accross the River to find GA's headquarters at "this.Pyramid". The game is simple get the boat accross the river intact, every time you have a bump a point is taken off your score. The most points wins. BEWARE theres a few surprises along the way.
		        			<br>	
		        			<br>
		        			This is a two player game powered by jQuery taking advantage of the animate and transform methods to make the crocodiles move and interact with the player. I was partically pleased with the moving river. The technologies I used were JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, jQuery - Animate and SoundManager.

		        			<p>Photo iQueue was inspired from my love of photography. Its a photo storage app that allows you to store your favourite photos on a cloud server with details of where the photos were took including location maps and technical details.

		        			<br>
		        			This is a rails app working with a PostgreSQL database to store the users photos on AWS S3 server. I followed an Agile work flow to create this app with the following technologies, JavaScript, HTML, Ruby, Active Record, Rails, SCSS, jQuery and jQuery - Animate.

		        		    <p>I joined General Assembly at the end of 2015. GA offers a coding bootcamp that aims to accelerate your learning and get you job ready for the programming world. It focuses on a practical Agile based structure that simulates how you would work in the industry. There is a huge amount that is covered in a short twelve week period including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Sinatra, PostgresSQL and NoSQL and Angular. My time at General Assembly was great, I have learnt so much.
